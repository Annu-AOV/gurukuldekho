        <h5>Information Collected</h5>
        <p>
            In general, you can visit this website without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. 
            Our web servers collect the domain names, not the e-mail addresses, of visitors. 
            In addition, there are portions of this website where we may need to collect personal information from you for a specific purpose, 
            such as to provide you with certain information you request. The information collected from you may include your name, 
            address, telephone, fax number or e-mail address, etc.
        </p>

        <h5>Use of Collected Information</h5>
        <p>
            Domain name information that we collect is not used to personally identify you and instead is aggregated to measure the number of visits, 
            average time spent on the site, pages viewed, etc. We use this information to measure the use of our site and to improve its content.
        </p>

        <p>
            When other information is collected from you, such as your name and e-mail address, we generally let you know at the time of collection 
            how we will use the personal information. Usually, we use the personal information you provide only to respond to your inquiry or 
            to process your request (such as to receive newsletters). This information may be shared with other GurukulDekho Networks in group 
            companies/businesses, but only if necessary to fulfill your request or for related purposes.
        </p>

        <p>In addition, we may have collected similar information from you in the past. By entering this website you are consenting to the terms of our information privacy policy and to our continued use of previously collected information. By submitting your personal information to us, you will be treated as having given your permission for the processing of your personal data as set out in this policy.</p>

        <p>We may share the personal information you provide with other companies we have hired to provide services for us. These companies - our vendors - are contractually bound to use personal information we share with them only to perform the services we have hired them to provide. We do not share, sell, or lease personal information about you to any third parties for their marketing use. We will release information about you if you do so, if we are required by law to do so, or in other legally limited circumstances (for example, to protect your account from fraud).</p>

        <p>If you register with one of GurukulDekho Networks business units online, they may use this information to provide you with customer information about GurukulDekho Networks offerings in support of your business needs. You should review the privacy policy associated with that GurukulDekho Network's business Web site for further information about that GurukulDekho Network's business privacy practices.
